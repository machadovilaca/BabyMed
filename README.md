Heartbits Hackathon Project

A 24 hour hackathon organized by CeSIUM (http://www.cesium.di.uminho.pt/) and ANEM (http://anem.pt/), where some multidisciplinary teams, must create an IT product to solve a problem in the health care area identified by them.

## Our project

Our main focus was to create a digital version of the current personal child health record.

### The Problem

To every family, disregarding the health condition of the baby, is given a book of static pages that doesn't answer the need of individual health care measures and advice.

## Features

* Child development record

* Recommended tasks checklists

* Targeted advices insuring an healthy baby development

* Photographic record of the most important growth achievements

* Schedule doctor's appointments and vaccines on Google Calendar

## Getting Started

For testing purposes I advice using Android Studio, it provides the fastest tools for building apps on every type of Android device: code editing, debugging, performance tooling, a flexible build system, and an instant build/deploy system all allow you to focus on building unique and high quality apps.
